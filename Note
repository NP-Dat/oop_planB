Notice
#1 We need setFocusable(true) to make GamePanel focus to the keyboard input, because sometimes setFocus doesnt work in Window OS ( Linux is okay )
#2 The program cannot get the image because the res folder (directory) need to be Mark(ed) directory as -> Resource root -> Done ( IDE IntelliJ )

- Episode #7
#3 In "Constant" class, In getSpriteAmount, dont forget to set the correct number of picture in the return of each case
